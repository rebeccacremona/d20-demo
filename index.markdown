<!-- ## About D20 Development

We run games of Dungeons & Dragons to develop collaboration, creative thinking, and communication skills.

Our Dungeon Master Chris has been running D&D games for 15 years, including published adventures and homebrew campaigns. He once talked 11 coworkers into trying it out, and they ended up playing for the next 2 years.

For this teambuilding exercise, we've designed a totally original adventure featuring a unique setting to play in and a story that lets players experience the three pillars of D&D: exploration, social interaction, and combat.

We provide all materials necessary to play, everything from pencils and dice to a range of pre-made characters. -->
